# The Weapons Platform
This is a framework designed to make the process of creating and testing new items easier both by providing editable example items with comments and also some basic testing QoL enhancements.

# Features
- Mod package ready to run and modify out of the box.
- A full Template Gun which contains the most commonly used properties and extensive comments.
- Basic Default and Charge Gun example templates for quicker setups.
- Example Passive and Active items.
- A modified Gunfig dll which allows automatic quick starting.
- The ability to automatically spawn weapons at the start of a run for immediate testing.
- A respawning training dummy with modifiable hp and up to 2 buddies.
- The Gunfiguration Mod's QoL settings include visible HP bars and damage numbers and is recommended to pair with this one as an additional testing feature.

# Instructions
- Save this repository to your Visual Studio repos folder.
- You can launch the project from the TheWeaponsPlatform.sln.
- Move the "TheWeaponsPlatform" folder to your BepInEx/plugins folder so that the mod loads with your thunderstore launcher despite not being installed through it.  Remember that since you're not updating through the thunderstore launcher, you'll need to manually transfer in any newly built dlls to this folder along with any relavant sprite updates.
- The autostart dll is here too so that function can be disabled by removing the dll.
